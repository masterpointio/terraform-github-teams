| Name                     | Description                                              | Type        | Required |

| repository_collaborators | Map of repositories to their list of collaborators       | map(list)   | no       |

For detailed type definitions and validation rules, see the [variables.tf](./variables.tf) file.

### Validation Rules

1. Team privacy must be either "secret" (default) or "closed".
2. Member roles must be either "member" (default) or "maintainer".
3. Repository collaborator permissions must be one of: "pull", "triage", "push", "maintain", "admin".
4. Repository names must follow the format "owner/repository".
5. Team map keys must match the slugified team name (lowercase, spaces replaced with hyphens).
6. Organization owners must be set as maintainers in teams.

These rules are enforced through the variable validation blocks, runtime checks, and test cases that verify all validation logic.
