# terraform-github-teams

[![Release][release-badge]][latest-release]

üí° Learn more about Masterpoint [below](#who-we-are-ê¶Çñ®ÜêÄ™ñ†ã).

## Purpose and Functionality

Terraform module for declaratively managing GitHub teams and their related settings within your organization. It enables you to:

- Manage GitHub teams and their configurations
- Control team memberships and roles
- Configure repository collaborators
- Manage organization membership
- Review request delegation settings
- Control team privacy

## Organization Memberships Management

### Enabling/Disabling Management

The module provides flexibility in managing organization memberships through the `organization_memberships_enabled` variable:

- When `true` (default):

  - Terraform creates GitHub organization memberships for all users listed in `organization_memberships`
  - Manages role assignments (admin/member)
  - Handles the `downgrade_on_destroy` behavior per member: when organization membership resource is destroyed, the member will not be removed from the organization. Instead, the member's role will be downgraded to `member`.

- When `false`:
  - No GitHub organization memberships are managed by Terraform
  - Team memberships and other resources continue to be managed

## Usage

### Prerequisites

1. A GitHub organization.
2. Organization admin access.
3. GitHub provider configuration with appropriate permissions.

### Example

```hcl
module "github_teams" {
  source  = "masterpointio/teams/github"
  version = "X.X.X"

  github_organization = "example-org"

  organization_memberships = [
    {
      username = "user1"
      role     = "admin"
    },
    {
      username = "user2"
      role     = "member"
    },
    {
      username = "user3"
      role     = "member"
    }
  ]
  teams = {
    "developers" = {
      name        = "Developers"
      description = "Development team"
      privacy     = "closed"
      members = [
        {
          username = "user1"
          role     = "maintainer"
        },
        {
          username = "user2"
          role     = "member"
        }
      ],
      review_request_delegation = {
        algorithm    = "ROUND_ROBIN"
        member_count = 2
        notify       = true
      }
    },
    "platform-engineers" = {
      name        = "Platform Engineers"
      description = "Platform engineering team"
      members = [
        {
          username = "user3"
          role     = "member"
        }
      ]
    }
  }

  repository_collaborators = {
    "example-org/repo1" = [
      {
        username   = "user3"
        permission = "push"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Validation Rules

The module enforces several validations:

- All team members must be listed in `organization_memberships`
- Valid roles (admin/member) for organization members
- Valid team member roles (maintainer/member)
- Team name slugification rules
- Repository collaborator permissions
